        <p>Undergraduate Researcher in the <a href="https://ncclab.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience of Cognitive Control Lab</a> at the <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>, mentored by <a href="https://jdc.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Jonathan D. Cohen</a>.</p>
        <p>My research involves computational cognitive science and deep learning for VLM interpretability and psychological analyses. This includes understanding the limitations of large language models in a variety of settings, such as the limitations of vision language models in multi-object reasoning tasks.</p>
