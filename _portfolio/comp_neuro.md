        <p>Undergraduate Researcher in the <a href="https://ncclab.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience of Cognitive Control Lab</a> at the <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>, mentored by <a href="https://jdc.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Jonathan D. Cohen</a>.</p>
        <p>My research involves leveraging mathematical frameworks, such as that of group theory, to explore specific problems in machine learning and natural language. This includes understanding the limitations of large language models in a variety of settings, including the limitations of vision language models in multi-object reasoning tasks.</p>
